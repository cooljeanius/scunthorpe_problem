Not your usual Scunthorpe; instead an attempt at language misdetection:

'^(;;|\(define_)'

(from here on out I'm searching `/usr/share/dict/words` and then cross-referencing against Wikipedia; WIP)

- words with "shit" as a substring:
  - Bereshit (Torah reading) (sometimes spelled "Bereshith")
  - brushite (phosphate mineral)
  - Cushite (person from Cush or Kush) (also Cushitic)
  - Elkoshite (Nahum 1:1)
  - Girgashite (another biblical tribe)
  - Marshite (mineral)
  - shitepoke (heron)
  - shittah tree (biblical) (see also: shittim, shittimwood)
  - Washita River
- words with "cum" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
- words with "cock" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
- words with "cialis" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
