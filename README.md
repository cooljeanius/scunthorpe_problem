Not your usual Scunthorpe; instead an attempt at language misdetection:

'^(;;|\(define_)'

(from here on out I'm searching `/usr/share/dict/words` and then cross-referencing against Wikipedia; WIP)

- Bereshit (Torah reading) (sometimes spelled "Bereshith")

- words with "cum" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
- words with "cock" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
- words with "cialis" as a substring: too many to list; skipping
- words with "allah" as a substring: there might actually be few enough of these to get them all; putting it off for now, though...
